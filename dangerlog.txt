Danger Log:

1. We do not limit the size and the number of request of the xml. What if an attacker DOS our server by having numerous request in a single xml (e.g. for create a lot of accounts, for transaction, create a lot of queeries/cancel/orders)?

2. Similarly, what if an attacker similarly connects but does not send anything? Or what if a client simply forgets to discconnect?

3. Currently, there are no credentials validation, meaning that you client can access the stocks and balance of another account.
